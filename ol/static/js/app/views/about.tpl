<p><strong>2. What do you mean "borrow"? Can I take the book away, for how long?</strong></p>

<p>Borrowing is something to be negotiated between borrowers and lenders. It may range from a rare or fragile book that cannot be lent but only read at location, to a pdf that can be sent over email. In principle, the lenders have listed these books with the intent to let others see and read them.</p>
